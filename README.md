# License Plate Recognition System using YOLOv7, Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and EasyOCR




## Overview

This project implements a license plate recognition system using YOLOv7 for object detection, Raspberry Pi for hardware integration, OpenCV for image processing, and EasyOCR for optical character recognition. The system is designed to detect license plates in images or video streams and extract the text from them for further processing or analysis.

## Dataset

- The entire dataset is made from scratch. I clicked around 600+ images. Then using Image Annotation techniques like flip, rotation, contrast, etc. the size of the dataset increased to around 1600+ images. 
- The dataset was then split into 89% Train images (1431), 7% Valid images (115) and 4% Test images (62).

## Features

- Object detection using YOLOv7
- Image processing and manipulation with OpenCV
- Optical character recognition (OCR) using EasyOCR
- Raspberry Pi integration for real-time applications
- Support for both image and video input
- Highly customizable and easy to extend
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- YOLOv7
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- Raspberry Pi (for hardware integration)
- Additional libraries as listed in requirements.txt
